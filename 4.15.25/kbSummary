# Document Structure Summary

Here's a concise summary of the different sections in this usability heuristics evaluation document:

## llmInstructions
Functions as the core operational guidance, establishing the expert role and providing a methodical 15-step evaluation process. Includes severity rating scale (0-4) and a standardized evaluation format for identifying and documenting issues.

## llmRules
Sets behavioral guidelines and constraints for maintaining objectivity during evaluations. Emphasizes neutral assessment, avoiding bias, using inclusive language, and focusing only on observable elements rather than assumptions.

## userInstructions
Provides practical guidance for users on how to submit interfaces for review, including what information to provide (screenshots, user journey details, target audience) and example queries. Contains follow-up actions for further analysis.

llmKnowledgeBase (General Description)
Functions as a specialized reference library containing domain-specific expertise necessary for conducting accurate evaluations. This repository of information varies depending on the type of analysis being performed. It provides the LLM with essential concepts, principles, frameworks, and best practices within the specific domain. The knowledge base allows for consistent application of standardized evaluation criteria while ensuring recommendations are grounded in established industry principles rather than subjective opinions.
In the example document, the knowledge base contained Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics, but other knowledge bases might contain different frameworks, regulations, or technical standards relevant to other types of evaluations.

The document functions as a comprehensive framework for conducting structured, objective usability evaluations based on established heuristic principles, with clear separation between LLM guidance and user-facing instructions.
