They are not specific individuals but synthesize the characteristics of many.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Purpose in Design:** To humanize users, build empathy, focus design decisions, aid communication across teams, and ensure products meet the needs of target audiences.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Key Components:** Demographics, goals, needs, motivations, pain points, behaviors, technology usage, financial profile, quotes. (Detailed components in Section 3).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **General vs. Workflow-Specific:**</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; *General Personas:* Represent broad user types across the entire product or service (e.g., &quot;Saver Sarah,&quot; &quot;Investor Ivan&quot;). Useful for overall strategy and high-level design.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; *Workflow-Specific Personas:* Focus on user characteristics relevant to a particular task or journey (e.g., &quot;First-Time Mortgage Applicant Maya,&quot; &quot;Experienced Options Trader Omar&quot;). Useful for detailed interaction design within a specific flow. Often derived or augmented from general personas.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">### User Stories</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Definition:** Short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Purpose in Agile Development:** To articulate user needs and value, facilitate conversation, serve as placeholders for requirements, and guide development priorities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Format:** Typically &quot;As a [type of user], I want [an action/goal] so that [a benefit/reason].&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **INVEST Criteria:** Good user stories are often described as:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; **I**ndependent (can be developed separately)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; **N**egotiable (not a rigid contract, details emerge in conversation)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; **V**aluable (delivers clear value to the user/stakeholder)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; **E**stimable (can be roughly sized by the development team)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; **S**mall (can be completed within a sprint/iteration)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; **T**estable (acceptance criteria can be defined)</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">### Use Cases</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Definition:** A description of the steps or actions between a user (actor) and a system to achieve a specific goal.

(Detailed structure in Section 3).</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">### Archetypes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Definition:** Symbolic representations of fundamental human patterns, motivations, and behaviors. Broader and more universal than personas. Focus on the &quot;why&quot; behind behavior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Purpose:** To understand underlying user motivations, guide high-level strategy and brand positioning, identify universal needs across diverse demographics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Components:** Title (e.g., The Security Seeker), Description, Core Motivations/Goals, Typical Behaviors, Needs/Pain Points. (Detailed archetypes in Section 3).</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">### Comparing Artifacts</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Persona vs. Archetype:**</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; *Persona:* Specific, detailed, research-based representation of a user *segment*. Grounded in demographics, context, specific goals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; *Archetype:* Universal, motivational pattern.

More about the &quot;why.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; *Usage:* Archetypes inform overall strategy and emotional design; Personas guide specific feature design and interaction details.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **User Story vs. Use Case:**</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; *User Story:* Focuses on the *Who, What, Why* (User need &amp; value). Small, negotiable placeholder for a requirement. Agile-centric.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; *Use Case:* Focuses on the *How* (Interaction steps). Detailed description of system-user interaction, including alternatives/errors. More formal requirement specification.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; *Relationship:* User stories often represent the high-level goal that a use case details. A use case might fulfill multiple user stories, or a complex user story might break down into multiple use cases.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">## 3.

**Include Non-Functional Needs:** Can be adapted, e.g., &quot;As a user, I need transaction history to load within 2 seconds so that I don&#39;t get frustrated.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Consider Compliance:** Integrate regulatory needs (See Section 6).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">* &nbsp; **Examples (Finance - See Section 5 &amp; 6 for more context):**</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;
