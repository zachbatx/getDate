### HMDA Data Collection Requirements

**When Demographic Data IS Required (Post-Application Only):**
1. **Timing**: Only AFTER application is submitted
2. **Presentation**: Clear explanation of why data is collected
3. **Voluntary Nature**: Emphasize that provision is optional
4. **Purpose Statement**: "This information is requested by the federal government for monitoring purposes"
5. **No Impact Statement**: "This will not affect your application decision"
6. **Visual Separation**: Clearly distinguished from application flow
7. **Skip Option**: Prominent ability to decline providing information

**Bottom Line Up Front**: Modern mortgage and home buying users span six distinct personas with vastly different digital expectations, from tech-savvy first-time buyers seeking mobile-first experiences to equity-rich downsizers preferring simplified interfaces. Traditional banks must design for accessibility-first experiences while accommodating behavioral differences and varying levels of digital literacy to capture their share of the $2.3 trillion mortgage market projected for 2025, all while maintaining strict regulatory compliance.

The mortgage landscape has fundamentally shifted, with first-time buyers now representing only 24% of the market—the lowest share on record—while their median age has risen to 38 years. Simultaneously, only 7% of banks can handle loan products digitally from start to finish, creating a massive opportunity for institutions that can deliver comprehensive digital experiences. These findings reveal six critical user personas that traditional banks must serve through both web and mobile platforms.

### Best Practices for Compliant Design
1. **Design for everyone**: Start with accessibility and inclusion
2. **Test with diverse users**: Include all protected classes
3. **Document decisions**: Keep records of compliance choices
4. **Train all team members**: Everyone owns compliance
5. **Monitor continuously**: Compliance is ongoing, not one-time
6. **Respond quickly**: Address issues immediately when found
7. **Be transparent**: Clear communication builds trust
8. **Exceed minimums**: Go beyond basic requirements
9. **Learn from mistakes**: Use issues as improvement opportunities
10. **Celebrate inclusion**: Make it part of company culture

### Remember: Good UX and Compliance Go Hand-in-Hand
- Accessible design benefits all users
- Clear communication reduces confusion and complaints
