# Comprehensive Personas and User Stories for Traditional Bank Digital Mortgage Platforms

**Bottom Line Up Front**: Modern mortgage and home buying users span six distinct personas with vastly different digital expectations, from tech-savvy first-time buyers seeking mobile-first experiences to equity-rich downsizers preferring simplified interfaces. Traditional banks must design for accessibility-first experiences while accommodating generational differences, income disparities, and varying levels of digital literacy to capture their share of the $2.3 trillion mortgage market projected for 2025.

The mortgage landscape has fundamentally shifted, with first-time buyers now representing only 24% of the market—the lowest share on record—while their median age has risen to 38 years. Simultaneously, only 7% of banks can handle loan products digitally from start to finish, creating a massive opportunity for institutions that can deliver comprehensive digital experiences. These findings reveal six critical user personas that traditional banks must serve through both web and mobile platforms.
