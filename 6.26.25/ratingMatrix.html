AI/ML Initiative Scoring Framework (1-3 Scale) - Detailed Version
1. Adoption Score

Score 1 (Low):

New/unfamiliar technology requiring significant onboarding
Limited availability to target users (<30% have access)
High resistance due to complexity or change aversion
Requires 2+ weeks of training per user
No existing user base or champions


Score 2 (Medium):

Some familiarity with similar tools exists
Available to 30-70% of target users
Moderate onboarding needed (3-5 days)
Partial integration with existing tools
Growing user community with early adopters


Score 3 (High):

Builds on existing, familiar technology
Available to >70% of users immediately
Minimal onboarding required (<1 day)
Intuitive interface matching current workflows
Strong existing user base and advocates



2. Efficiency Score

Score 1 (Low):

Creates additional context switching
Requires leaving current workflow entirely
<20% reduction in task completion time
Poor integration with existing tools
May actually add steps to some processes


Score 2 (Medium):

Some context switching but manageable
Partial workflow integration achieved
20-50% effort/time reduction on tasks
API/plugin available for key systems
Streamlines most common use cases


Score 3 (High):

Seamless workflow integration
Eliminates context switching entirely


50% reduction in effort and time


Native integration or embedded in current tools
Automates entire process chains



3. Productivity Score

Score 1 (Low):

Accuracy <70%, frequent manual corrections needed
Inconsistent outcomes requiring rework
<15% performance improvement
Limited impact on key deliverables
Quality concerns offset time savings


Score 2 (Medium):

70-90% accuracy, occasional adjustments
Generally consistent results
15-40% productivity gains
Noticeable impact on output quality
Enables focus on higher-value work


Score 3 (High):



90% accuracy and consistency


Reliable, predictable outcomes


40% productivity increase


Transformative impact on deliverables
Enables entirely new capabilities



4. Technology Readiness Score

Score 1 (Low):

Proof-of-concept or alpha stage
Requires substantial integration effort (>3 months)
Frequent bugs/downtime (>10% failure rate)
Limited testing in production environments
Significant customization needed


Score 2 (Medium):

Beta/pilot stage, mostly developed
Moderate integration effort (1-3 months)
Occasional issues (5-10% failure rate)
Tested in similar environments
Some configuration required


Score 3 (High):

Fully developed and production-tested
Immediate deployment possible
Already integrated or plug-and-play
Highly reliable (<5% failure rate)
Existing technology with proven track record



5. Scalability Score

Score 1 (Low):

Limited to specific team/department
Licensing restricts user growth
Extensive training limits expansion
Technical constraints on concurrent users
High per-user costs


Score 2 (Medium):

Available to multiple departments
Reasonable licensing model
Standardized training available
Some technical integration needed
Moderate scaling costs


Score 3 (High):

Available enterprise-wide immediately
Unlimited or generous licensing
Self-service onboarding possible
Cloud-based with auto-scaling
Minimal marginal cost per user
