This white paper evaluates the current state of digital accessibility in the financial services sector. It provides a comparative analysis of how top financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, are addressing digital accessibility, the standards and policies they follow, the challenges they face, and their responses to customer complaints and litigation.

Importance of Digital Accessibility in Financial Services

Digital accessibility ensures that all customers, including those with disabilities, can access online banking, financial services, and digital content. As financial services increasingly move online, ensuring digital platforms are accessible is not just a regulatory requirement but also a business imperative that enhances customer experience and inclusivity.
