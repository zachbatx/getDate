The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not explicitly mention digital accessibility, as it was enacted before the rise of the internet and digital technologies. However, the ADA's principles have been interpreted to apply to digital accessibility in several ways:

Title II
State and Local Government Services: Title II of the ADA requires state and local governments to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to their programs, services, and activities. This has been interpreted to include digital content such as websites and online services.
Title III
Public Accommodations: Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the activities of places of public accommodations. This includes businesses and nonprofit service providers that are generally open to the public. Courts have interpreted this to include websites and digital services provided by these entities, requiring them to be accessible to individuals with disabilities.
Department of Justice (DOJ) Guidance
The DOJ has provided guidance stating that the ADA's requirements apply to websites and other digital content, reinforcing the need for digital accessibility to ensure compliance with the ADA.
Case Law
Various court rulings have established precedents for interpreting the ADA to require digital accessibility, emphasizing that websites and online services must be accessible to individuals with disabilities to avoid discrimination.
Section 508 (Related Legislation)
While not part of the ADA, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. This complements the ADA's principles and further underscores the importance of digital accessibility.
In summary, while the ADA does not specifically mention digital accessibility, its provisions, particularly under Titles II and III, have been interpreted to require that digital content and services be accessible to individuals with disabilities.
