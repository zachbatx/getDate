"I've uploaded a reference document titled 'PDF Techniques for WCAG 2.0' that details best practices for PDF accessibility according to WCAG 2.0. Now, please use the guidelines and techniques from that document to analyze the attached PDF for accessibility issues. I need a detailed, no-nonsense assessment that:

Identifies all accessibility problems (e.g., missing or incorrect tagging, inadequate alternative text, poor color contrast, navigation issues, etc.)
Explains why each issue is problematic in the context of WCAG 2.0
Provides clear, step-by-step recommendations for fixing each issue
Offers forward-thinking insights into improvements that not only meet current standards but also anticipate future accessibility needs
Be direct and thorough in your evaluation, without sugar-coating any deficiencies."
